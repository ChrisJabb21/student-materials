Directions

In this Hands-On Project, we will begin the first of a series of project planning exercises. You will be required to plan out a project using the Waterfall method. Our focus in this exercise will be to produce business requirements for a project. Through this activity, you will come to understand the major value (and criticism) of the Waterfall method: planning and documentation. This Hands-On will be graded, so be sure you complete all requirements.
Requirements

Leveraging what you've learned about the Waterfall method, you will be required to produce one of the key artifacts: Business Requirements. We have provided an example project for you to plan; however, you are welcome to begin planning for a project of your own if you prefer. Either way, you must meet all requirements listed below.

    Modify the requirements to fill in detail in the main sections. Your goal is to be as descriptive as possible to avoid confusion. Your resulting document should be around 1500 words.
    This document should describe all details needed to deliver a project.
    Imagine that you will turn over this document to another team to develop, do they have all the details they need?
    Consider that you are accountable for this project, but most likely won't be the one building it, what risks do you see? Describe them.

Example Project:

Feel free to plan any project you like; however, if you need inspiration for a project to design, you may use the following:

    Exeter (your client) is asking you to plan a project to develop a web application which will allow students to connect with like-minded students for projects.

    They would like a student to be able to log into a web application and either post an idea for a project or search for other student's ideas to find something they are interested in working on.

    The students will need the ability to connect with each other and discuss working together. Any options to make the application more social would be valued.

    The client values quality and innovative solution or something that is quick to market. They are looking to you and your team to help define some features that would motivate students to engage in using this platform to connect and build better communication.
