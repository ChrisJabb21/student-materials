# ProjMeet: The Project Collaboration Meet-up Web Application for Exeter Online LMS Students
By Christopher F. Jabbour 

## Executive Summary

*This document outlines the requirements for the development of a web application which will allow the  like-minded students to connect and interact with each other for the purpose of collaborating and communicating with each other for projects based on the requirements and needs for the client, Exeter.* 

*It will entail all of the following about the app itself: underlying business objectives, background  information, scope,  the functional and personnel requirements needed for the implementation and creation of the project, and proposed delivery schedule for the development and deployment of the project as a whole.  From the front-end to back-end requirements needed to make the app functional. Assumptions for creating and development of this app, any type of limitations to consider when putting the web app together along with possible risks that can come about when developing the application to consider will also be mentioned in this document.*


## Business Objectives

*The objective of this project is to provide the users, students that use the Exeter LMS, a way to be able to communicate and give them the means to engage in group efforts for working on projects. This is important as this software would increase the productivity of the students using the online learning. It should be able to allow each group member that is a part of their own group to keep track of their files and work as if they are on the same network file system or drive they are working in.* 

*The value of this project is that it will offer more accountable control with group members within a group. One possible advantage is that it would allow the instructors and mentors of the groups to keep track of each group and group member in case adminstrative action is needed or if a student is struggling.*  

*The goal is to make the app able to motivate students to engage in using this platform to connect and reinforce better communication between the students.*


## Background

*Provide any relevant background information regarding why this project is being initiated*

The background for starting this project is to allow for students to post ideas in a post-based way similar to a social media user interface, like Facebook for example. It is being initiated to:

1.)  Promote the goal of learning and engagement for the student users.
2.) To be able to motivate the users to use the platform by making the usability simple and intuitive for use.

It should be made so it can be able to link with a students account that was made and assigned to each of them to log into the Exeter LMS.



## Scope

What should be included? 
*It should be a system that emphasizes the main values and needs of the client and end goals of the web app software. Which is to provide quality and an innovative solution while making the software quick to market.*

*What is not needed is a completely different web site with  all different accounts. It should be innovative but not have to reinvent the wheel with the social aspects. It would need to take the best of what social media sites have already done which is encourage engagement and to use the same methods, functionality, and user interface for the users themselves.*

*It should be able to be integrated with the Exeter LMS in terms of accounts and making the website compatible with the databases that the LMS uses will save the hassle of to copy all of the users on the system into a new one or have them go through the process of creating new accounts. But should be considered if the development team runs into any hitch with the website and web app integration process.*


What is not included?
*Any type of file sharing service and voice chat tools should be implemented and supplemented as well similar to the manner of Google Drive, Google Hangouts, and Slack for allowing students to group each other together and allow for the flow of communication. We can allow for sharing, commenting, and interaction with different types of files as well as file permissions a user creates and saves onto the system. These features would be nice to implement in the long run.*


## Functional requirements

*For the web app we will need to make it so the users can log in to their Exeter accounts and be able to see tabs or navigation options for the header that allow for the users to navigate between the posts feeds, the users individual messages and group pages as well.* 

*For helping with students finding a project to work on, a search engine to parse though all the posts that each student makes so that it can help students find projects to collaborate with other students with and be able to click on the student poster's profile to be able to send a message and engage in conversation in a direct message kind of style and have features to add or remove students from groups depending on the post creator or project leader for a certain project.*

## Personnel requirements

*Based on the expectations of the client to plan, design, and implement the web app solution will require several talents and specialities needed to create and communicate the needs clearly. The teams will need to be split into different focus groups.  One think to consider when creating and planning personnel to work on project is the seniority or years of experience. It would be wise to have someone who is efficient in the languages and be able to work effectively in their teams and with meeting the needs of management for the project.*

The Project manager and development teams with have to come together and discuss what solutions the developers are comfortable using and means or resources needed to be able to start working on the project and distribute the work among themselves.

Development team
	UI/UX design
	Front End Development
	Back End Development

QA and Testing Team
	(can be employees and users)


*Note: To reduce costs, the UI Design teams can be integrated into the Front End Development teams. You can even reduce the costs or personnel needed by having developers both sufficient.*

*The development team should be a group of between 10 or 15 people. The Quality Assurance team can be around just 3 or 5 people to allow for constructive feedback on the web app as they test and use all of the features.*



## Delivery Schedule

*The documentation for the project and requirements phase may take a couple of days to be written and compiled to be shared with the stakeholders and project leads for the software solution and all of the main requirements of the client will be emphasized in the first parts of the document itself. In making the delivery schedule for the project, the more intensive parts of the project will come about with the Design and implementation phase. this will be because the software will in the process of being planned out by the development team where the work will be planned out for the requirements.* 

Milestones should be planned out so that the development team is given enough time for the working on the project phases and will be able to get most of the work done that is needed before the deadline of each project milestone. 

Week 1-3 
Design Phase
Making design documentation such as architectural and user interface designs from the requirements specifications so that they can be turned into the development team to work on based on the needs of the client.


Week 3-6
Implementation Phase
The programmers phase and when actual development takes place


Week 7-8 
Verification Phase 
QA tests done on product to validate that the application is working as designed and all requirements have been met.
This is done by a QA team separate from development where they document the testing process and test cases.

(Dependent on management and support for product)

Deployment and Maintenance Phase

When the app is launched and the customer is using the app itself.  As problems are found, changes are made to the product during this phase.*

## Other requirements

*This section serves as a catch-all for any details that may not fit in other areas.  things like device or browser support, considerations for accessibility or inspiration for style.  Offer additional context here to ensure the project meets your vision*


## Assumptions

*Assumptions for creating and development of this app requires will be taken into account and mentioned in enough detail for anyone with experience in software development and project management. From what we know and can assume about the web app and what features we expect the users to want and be able to do when.* 

*We should expect that the students are familiar with using group instant messenger services and to provide as close to functionality as possible based on the most popular examples. We need to assume that the user interface is visually appealing and user friendly for reusability value which will be vital for user engagement and satisfaction.*


## Limitations

*The limitations can range from many different internal and external factors. One limitation can be in personnel working on the project who aren't as experienced or may struggle with meeting the requirements needed for the project phases.*

## Risks

*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*

*The risks that can be appear in the development of creating the project can be problems with the search engine for the web app in getting the search queries to display results. Another risk can be the students perception of the web app and whatever it is necessary or necessity when compared to other options of communications. So because of this, it would be good to consider feedback from the users and look at the web app with the perspective of the users to see if the software solution is worth the effort, value, and return on investment.*

*Another thing to consider for this web app is considering access control permissions for users and proper  web security measures are in place for using the web app.*
